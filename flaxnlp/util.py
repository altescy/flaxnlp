def flip_sequences(inputs: Array, lengths: Array) -> Array:
    """Flips a sequence of inputs along the time dimension.
    This function can be used to prepare inputs for the reverse direction of a
    bidirectional LSTM. It solves the issue that, when naively flipping multiple
    padded sequences stored in a matrix, the first elements would be padding
    values for those sequences that were padded. This function keeps the padding
    at the end, while flipping the rest of the elements.
    Example:
    ```python
    inputs = [[1, 0, 0],
              [2, 3, 0]
              [4, 5, 6]]

                                       [6, 5, 4]]
    ```
    Args:
      inputs: An array of input IDs <int>[batch_size, seq_length].
      lengths: The length of each sequence <int>[batch_size].
    Returns:
      An ndarray with the flipped inputs.
